Plans for development :

First research and understand how to properly pass in a pointer that points to a InputHandler object
located in main , In order to have one InputHandler object handle all the input rather than creating a new object 
each time it is needed.

Secondly , Start Looking into implementing the Generator class . In order to do this first we will have to figuire
out how to generate a truley random string out of the selected string parameters i.e (lowercase alpha , UpperCase Alpha , 0-9 etc.)
